#  A Unified Framework for Autonomous Recursive Alignment in Large Language Models

This paper presents a general-purpose framework for training **self-aligning LLMs** via recursive reasoning, without reliance on human feedback or handcrafted rewards. The model integrates **autonomous programmatic alignment**, **reflective ranking**, and **multi-phase self-distillation**, allowing LLMs to align behaviors through their own recursive evaluations.

We introduce a unified architecture that brings together synthetic supervision, in-context self-ranking, and modular alignment phases ‚Äî improving helpfulness, harmlessness, and truthfulness, while significantly reducing alignment cost and human dependency.

## ‚ùì Problem

Current alignment techniques like RLHF and Constitutional AI rely heavily on human preference data and fixed reward models. This is:
- Expensive to scale
- Prone to bias and instability
- Inefficient for long-horizon reasoning tasks

## ‚úÖ Solution

We propose a fully autonomous recursive alignment framework that:
- Uses **multi-phase in-context ranking** with self-generated prompts
- Employs **programmatic supervision** for reward modeling
- Utilizes **recursive self-distillation** to iteratively refine alignment
- Avoids any need for RL or external human feedback

This results in a cost-efficient, self-reinforcing loop for training trustworthy LLMs.

## üß™ Recursive Alignment Benchmark

The framework was evaluated on the HHH alignment benchmark, showing superior performance to RLHF and Constitutional AI baselines. Improvements were observed in:
- Truthfulness
- Harmlessness
- Helpfulness
With dramatically reduced reliance on supervised data.
